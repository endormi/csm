# Color Scheme Manager (csm)

The Color Scheme Manager (csm) for your projects enabling customization and management of color schemes.

Currently supported by two languages: [Ruby](/csmrb) as a [Ruby gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/csm) and [Python](/csmpy) as a [Python package](https://pypi.org/project/csmpy/).

## Why?

I enjoy developing CLI scripts and tools using various languages. It's essential that these projects maintain consistency in customization, no matter the language.

This is mainly for reusing in my projects, but it's also designed to be user-friendly for others. It's straightforward and simple, because complicating code is impractical and unnecessary.
